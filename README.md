See [Setup Guide](https://github.com/real-datagram/l1demo/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for full build & flashing instructions.

The engine is compiled with the XC16 GCC compiler by Microchip. Programming can be done in a variety of ways: GUI USB bootloader, ds30 (command line) USB bootloader, GUI MPLAB X IDE flashing (with Pickit3), GUI MPLAB IPE (with Pickit3), or command line MPLAB IPE (with Pickit3). The GUI USB bootloader is the easiest to use and is recommended for beginners.
